# Future Roadmap (Task Hub)

This is the **high-signal entrypoint** for near-term work.

- **Task-system contract**: `docs/TASK_MANAGEMENT.md`
- **Deep implementation notes**: `docs/DESIGN_REMAINING_ISSUES.md`
- **History / prior long-form roadmap**: `docs/roadmap/ROADMAP_ARCHIVE.md`

---

## Notes for Agents

- Default: read **only** the `## Now` section unless deeper context is required.
- Keep scope tight: pick **one** item, confirm insertion points, implement minimally, and update status.

| 21 | P1 | Model selection driven by `llm_config.yml` (single source of truth) | 🔲 Pending |
