All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-12-25

### Security
-   **CRITICAL**: Removed all hardcoded API Keys from `content.js` and `options.js`. Configuration now acts strictly through `chrome.storage`.
-   **Network**: Implemented `AbortController` in background script to automatically cancel pending API requests when the frontend disconnects (e.g., tab closed).

### Added
-   **Smart Batching**: The translation engine now groups paragraphs (batch size: 5) into a single API request. This significantly improves translation coherence and reduces API call frequency.
-   **Immersive Protocol**: Established a standard `%%` separator protocol with the LLM. The system prompt now strictly enforces this format, and the client parser robustly handles `\n%%\n` delimiters in the stream.
-   **Style Inheritance**: Translated text now dynamically inherits `text-align`, `font-weight`, and `font-size` from the parent element.

### Fixed
-   **Layout Breakage**: Changed the injection method from "Sibling Node" to "Child Span" (`appendChild`). This prevents breaking parent Flex/Grid containers.
-   **Duplicate Translation**: Fixed a bug in `isSeparatelyTranslated` where the scanner failed to detect existing translations under the new "Child Span" architecture.
-   **Responsiveness**: Implemented a Worker Queue (Concurrency = 1) to prevent freezing the browser UI during heavy translation tasks.

### Changed
-   **System Prompt**: completely rewritten to follow the "Immersive Translate" standard prompt, enforcing strict output formats and forbidding conversational filler.
